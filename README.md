### School_District_Analysis
Module 4

# Overview 
The purpose of this project is so analyze school data; such as test scores, student numbers, passing paramteres etc., in order to provide more detailed information
about these schools and these students. These analyses are completed through Python and Jupyter Notebook software(s), using skills such as building Dataframes, 
changing or manipulating data, and seeing how these changes affect the bigger picture. 

# Results
Upon finding evidence of academic dishonesty in the test scores of Thomas High School ninth graders, both the math and reading score are compromised.This can be observed in the
[Resources/students_complete.csv](Resources/students_complete.csv).Our client Maria has tasked us with removing these score, replacing them with a "NaN' value, and then re-analyzing the data from there. 
After doing so, we can observe the following; 

* How is the district summary affected?

* How is the school summary affected?

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
* Math and reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school size
* Scores by school type

# Summary 


A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school

She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.


Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs

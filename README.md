# School_District_Analysis
Module 4

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is so analyze school data; such as test scores, student numbers, passing paramteres etc., in order to provide more detailed information
about these schools and these students. These analyses are completed through Python and Jupyter Notebook software(s), using skills such as building Dataframes, 
changing or manipulating data, and seeing how these changes affect the bigger picture. 

## Results
Upon finding evidence of academic dishonesty in the test scores of Thomas High School ninth graders, both the math and reading score are compromised.This can be observed in the
[Resources/students_complete.csv](Resources/students_complete.csv).Our client Maria has tasked us with removing these score, replacing them with a "NaN' value, and then re-analyzing the data from there. Unfortunately I was unable to complete the removal of these scores, however I have completed all other requirements. Therefore my results will be
also based on a best educated guess, and I will try my best to accurately predict these results. 
After doing so, we can observe the following;

* **How is the district summary affected?

Thomas Highschool averages and the associated district averages have gone down.

* **How is the school summary affected?**

The overall passing rate in Thomas High School has gone down. 


* **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

Unfortunately given my incomplete code, the position relative to other schools post removal is incomplete. I do predict however that the school will ranksubstantially lower, due to the removal of a large number of high-performing students. 

* **How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
* **Math and reading scores by grade**

All grades except the ninth grade are affected minimally. Ninth grade scores are largely Nan post removal. 

* **Scores by school spending**

The score goes down, therefore Thomas High School ranks lower per dollar spent post grade removal. 

* **Scores by school size**

The scores based on school size will decrease. Thomas High school is in the "medium" school bucket. 

* **Scores by school type**

Due to my lack of information I am unable to comment on this section.
